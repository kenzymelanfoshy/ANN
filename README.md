# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for [specific task, e.g., classification, regression, etc.]. The project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an ANN using a specific dataset.

## Introduction

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. This project demonstrates how to implement an ANN from scratch using [specific library, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.], and evaluates its performance on a given dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [describe the dataset, e.g., a collection of labeled images, numerical data, etc.]. It is divided into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization:** Scaling the input features to a specific range.
- **Splitting:** Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
- **Data Augmentation (if applicable):** Applying transformations to increase the diversity of the training data.


## Features

- **Model Architecture:** The ANN is designed with multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers, with [activation functions, e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.].
- **Training:** The model is trained using [loss function, e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy, etc.] and optimized with [optimizer, e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.].
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
